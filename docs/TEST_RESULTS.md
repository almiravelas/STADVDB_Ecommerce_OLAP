## OLAP Test Results

### 1. get_user_data (no filters) - User Aggregation Query

**Purpose:** Validate per-user aggregations (SUM sales_amount, COUNT DISTINCT orders).

#### Seed Data
**dim_user:**
```
 user_key continent     country   city gender
        1      Asia Philippines Manila   Male
        2      Asia       Japan  Tokyo Female
        3    Europe     Germany Berlin Female
```

**fact_sales:**
```
order_number  customer_key  sales_amount
       ORD-1             1         100.0
       ORD-2             1         200.0
       ORD-2             1          50.0   ← same order_number, different line
       ORD-3             2         300.0
       ORD-4             3         400.0
```

#### Query Result (Aggregated by user_key)
```
 user_key continent     country   city gender  sales_amount  total_orders
        1      Asia Philippines Manila   Male         350.0             2
        2      Asia       Japan  Tokyo Female         300.0             1
        3    Europe     Germany Berlin Female         400.0             1

Shape: (3, 7)
```

#### Validation Results ✅
- ✓ All users present: [1, 2, 3]
- ✓ User 1: sales_amount = 100 + 200 + 50 = **350.0**
- ✓ User 1: total_orders = DISTINCT(ORD-1, ORD-2) = **2** (not 3, despite 3 rows)
- ✓ User 2: sales_amount = **300.0**, total_orders = **1**
- ✓ User 3: sales_amount = **400.0**, total_orders = **1**

#### Key Observations
1. **SUM aggregation:** Correctly sums all sales rows per user
2. **DISTINCT counting:** User 1 has 3 fact rows but only 2 DISTINCT orders (ORD-2 appears twice)
3. **JOIN correctness:** All user attributes (continent, country, city, gender) preserved
4. **Pre-aggregation:** One row per user (not per transaction), optimizing data transfer

---

### 2. get_user_data (with filters) - Filtered User Query

**Purpose:** Validate demographic filters work correctly.

#### Filter Criteria
- continents = ['Asia']
- genders = ['Female']

#### Query Result (Filtered)
```
 user_key continent country  city gender  sales_amount  total_orders
        2      Asia   Japan Tokyo Female         300.0             1

Shape: (1, 7)
```

#### Validation Results ✅
- ✓ Only user 2 matches (Asia, Japan, Female)
- ✓ User 2: sales_amount = **300.0**, total_orders = **1**

#### Filter Logic Explanation
| User | Continent | Country | City | Gender | Asia Filter | Female Filter | Result |
|------|-----------|---------|------|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1    | Asia      | Philippines | Manila | Male | ✓ Pass | ✗ Fail | Excluded |
| 2    | Asia      | Japan   | Tokyo | Female | ✓ Pass | ✓ Pass | **Included** |
| 3    | Europe    | Germany | Berlin | Female | ✗ Fail | ✓ Pass | Excluded |

#### Key Observations
1. **AND logic:** All filter conditions must match (continents AND genders)
2. **IN clauses:** Each filter can contain multiple values (list expansion)
3. **Null handling:** No null issues; all demographic fields populated
4. **Performance:** Pre-aggregation + WHERE clause efficient for large datasets

---

### 3. get_distinct_user_attributes - Filter Options Query

**Purpose:** Provide distinct values for UI filter dropdowns.

#### Query Result (Distinct Attributes)
```
Continents: ['Asia', 'Europe']
Countries:  ['Germany', 'Japan', 'Philippines']
Cities:     ['Berlin', 'Manila', 'Tokyo']
Genders:    ['Female', 'Male']
```

#### Validation Results ✅
- ✓ Continents contain Asia and Europe
- ✓ All seeded countries present (Germany, Japan, Philippines)
- ✓ Both genders present (Female, Male)

#### Use Case
These lists populate the filter dropdowns in the Streamlit UI, allowing users to:
1. Select which continents to include in analysis
2. Filter by specific countries within those continents
3. Drill down to city-level demographics
4. Segment by gender for targeted insights

#### Key Observations
1. **UNION ALL approach:** Single query retrieves all attribute types efficiently
2. **Sorted output:** Results ordered by attr_type, then value (alphabetical)
3. **No duplicates:** GROUP BY ensures distinct values only
4. **NULL handling:** WHERE clauses filter out any null values

## Conclusion

All functional tests passed successfully, validating:

1. **ETL Correctness:**
   - Data type conversions and normalizations
   - Computed measures (sales_amount = quantity × price)
   - Foreign key renames for star schema
   - Date standardization to integer keys
   - Geographic and demographic mappings
   - Category standardization and deduplication
   - Vehicle type and courier name corrections

2. **OLAP Correctness:**
   - Pre-aggregated queries (SUM, COUNT DISTINCT)
   - Multi-table JOINs (fact_sales ⟕ dim_user ⟕ dim_rider ⟕ dim_product ⟕ dim_date)
   - Filter handling (continents, countries, cities, genders)
   - Distinct value extraction for UI controls
   - Order-level and product+date aggregations
   - Time-series analysis (monthly, yearly, weekend vs weekday, daily trends, day-of-week)
   - Dashboard KPIs (totals, averages, counts)
   - Top performer rankings (customers, riders, products)
   - Multi-dimensional analysis (category×time, courier×time)

The before/after comparisons demonstrate that the ETL pipeline correctly transforms raw source data into a clean, normalized star schema, and the OLAP queries efficiently aggregate and filter this data for analytical purposes across all dimensions: users, riders, products, and time. The additional date-based and dashboard tests validate comprehensive business intelligence capabilities including trend analysis, KPI monitoring, and multi-dimensional segmentation.
